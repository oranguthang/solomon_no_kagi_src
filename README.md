# Solomon's Key NES Disassembly

A byte-identical ca65 reconstruction and reverse-engineering workspace for the
USA NES release of **Solomon's Key** (`NES-KE-USA`). The project follows the
preservation-first structure of the sibling `smb1_src` repository: a stable
baseline, explicit ROM identity, reproducible build artifacts, documented
evidence, and small tested tools for decoded game data.

## Current status

- The complete 65,552-byte iNES image assembles byte-for-byte.
- `make verify` checks the header, PRG, CHR, complete payload, and complete file.
- The address-ordered PRG source is included by a small `src/main.asm`
  entrypoint; CHR is a private generated asset and is not stored in Git.
- Confirmed NES registers and high-confidence RAM aliases are separated into
  `src/memory/`.
- One hundred forty semantic PRG modules own NMI (`$8000-$80FE`), controller input
  (`$837D-$83C1`), reset/startup
  (`$8C00-$8D5E`), the cooperative scheduler (`$8D5F-$8E46`), and the main
  gameplay thread (`$A000-$A04B`), plus countdown timer arithmetic and warning
  transitions (`$A15F-$A225`), its HUD update builder (`$A238-$A273`), and
  the enemy movement prepass (`$A274-$A2DB`) plus AI dispatcher
  (`$A2DC-$A30B`), and fireball lifetime service (`$A3A4-$A3D6`).
  Enemy slot position/state initialization owns `$A3D7-$A3F7`, followed by
  type-specific object/AI configuration at `$A3F8-$A44D` and its table at
  `$A44E-$A468`. The inline 28-entry enemy AI handler dispatcher owns
  `$A469-$A4A5`, followed by its shared position-copy helper at
  `$A4A6-$A4B2`. Shared object/AI record pointer helpers own `$B28A-$B2A1`,

  `$CA6E-$CB6E`.
  Full clearing of both physical nametables owns `$CB6F-$CBA5`.
  Packed title graphics, score/best-score/GDV presentation, and fixed logo
  patterns own `$CBA6-$CD52`; both packed streams and the parallel demo
  duration/input tables continue through `$CF34`.
  All 58 four-byte RoomMap tile patterns are source-owned at `$D000-$D0E7`.
  The parallel 33-entry object-animation descriptor pointer table follows at
  `$D0E8-$D129`.
  All 340 action descriptors, four variant selectors, 126 referenced animation
  sequences, and 275 three-byte frame records continue through `$D9D2`.
  Object-type motion pointers, 20 action-selector groups, and all 35 paired Y/X
  motion vectors are source-owned at `$D9D3-$DBDE`.
  Classified filler and the complete Demon Mirror schedule/enemy-set data
  continue through `$DCEB`.

  cyclic enemy-set, and activation runtime own `$A000-$A15E`.
  Object surface clamps own `$8A62-$8ABF`; the type/action-driven motion and
  animation definition loader follows at `$8AC0-$8B50`.
  The complete 21-record object update, fixed-point motion, RoomMap collision
  sampling, and animation sequencer own `$863C-$87DF`.
  The collision dispatcher, 16-entry handler table, all mask responses, and
  shared `$...D` Y clamp continue through `$8A61`.
  The NMI RoomMap attribute reader owns `$8B51-$8B7E`, followed by the PPU
  stream interpreter at `$8B7F-$8BE1` and classified pre-Reset filler through
  `$8BFF`; the blocking producer for
  18 ROM-resident streams owns `$9471-$9487`, followed by the split pointer

  room-entry animation, fifteen-object orbit, scaled sine lookup, and source
  table continue through `$9470`.

  output.
- `scripts/room_data.py` decodes the block planes, enemy streams, item streams,
  and ten-byte metadata headers for all 53 room records.
- `scripts/object_animation_data.py` validates all 33 type pointers, 340
  action descriptors, four variant selectors, and 275 animation frame records.
- `scripts/object_motion_data.py` validates all 33 motion-table pointers, 20
  selector groups, 388 action selectors, and 35 paired Y/X vectors.
- Architecture, RAM, room formats, provenance, naming policy, and unknowns are
  recorded under `docs/`.
- Initial Mesen watches and breakpoints live under `config/` with a trace
  workflow in `docs/debugger_workflow.md`.

The preservation source is not yet a fully semantic modular disassembly.
Most operands and generated labels still use raw addresses. The byte-identical
baseline is intentionally frozen first; semantic renames and subsystem splits
can now proceed behind a permanent verification gate.

## Reference image

The baseline is exactly:

```text
Solomon's Key (USA)
File size  65,552 bytes
File SHA-1 18102689fd35c7d531a5e6241b06b748accab2f6
ROM CRC32  40684e95 (headerless PRG + CHR)
Mapper     3 (CNROM), horizontal mirroring
PRG        32 KiB, loaded at $8000-$FFFF
CHR        32 KiB, four switchable 8 KiB banks
```

The full identity contract is in `assets/manifest.json`. ROM files and locally
extracted assets are ignored by Git.

## Building

On Windows, the repository includes matched ca65/ld65 2.19 executables:

```bash
make build
make verify
```

The build produces the ROM, listing, labels, linker map, and debug records in
`build/native/`. `make verify` validates the original and built images
independently against the manifest, then compares the header, PRG, CHR,
headerless payload, complete file, and extracted CHR asset byte-for-byte.
Mismatch diagnostics include the first differing file/region offset and a CPU
address for PRG differences.

Before the first build, place a legally obtained matching image outside Git and
extract its CHR payload with:

```bash
make split
```

The default filename is `Solomon's Key (U) [!].nes`. Override it when needed:

```bash
make split REFERENCE_ROM="path/to/Solomon's Key (USA).nes"
```

This validates the complete image plus its header, PRG, and CHR identities,
then writes only the ignored `assets/generated/chr/solomons_key.chr`. Builds
fail with a focused instruction if this private asset is absent.

## Useful targets

make item-handler-audit # verify all 29 item pointers and the table hash
make enemy-pointer-report # decode the split object/AI record pointer tables
make enemy-pointer-audit # verify pointer bases, strides, and counts
make ppu-update-report # decode all 18 static PPU update streams as JSON
make ppu-update-audit # verify pointers, coverage, hashes, and byte round trips
make roundtrip-formats # round-trip rooms and Demon Mirror data
make release-check # complete static, test, identity, and room-data gate
make check       # alias for release-check
make rooms       # decode all 53 rooms as JSON
make validate-rooms # structurally decode every room without JSON output
make clean       # remove build artifacts only
```

Focused identity targets also include `verify-reference`, `verify-built`,
`verify-header`, `verify-payload`, and `verify-rom`. See
`docs/verification.md` for their exact contracts.

To inspect one room without emitting all room records:

```bash
python scripts/room_data.py --image build/native/solomons_key.nes --room 1 --pretty
```

## Evidence boundary

Names in source and documentation are classified as confirmed,
high-confidence, tentative, or unknown. A readable name is not treated as
proof by itself. Static control flow, pointer tables, read/write traces, and
repeatable runtime scenarios are the intended evidence layers. See
`docs/naming.md` and `docs/unknowns.md`.

## Upstream material and rights

The preservation listing was imported from
[rbmichael/solomons_key_disassembly](https://github.com/rbmichael/solomons_key_disassembly),
which attributes the original disassembly to `ninespaces`. That repository did
not contain an explicit license when imported. This project therefore does not
assert a blanket license over the imported listing or game data. Original
tooling and documentation should be treated separately from third-party and
copyrighted material. See `docs/provenance.md` for the complete source ledger.

This is an unofficial preservation and research project. Solomon's Key and its
game data remain property of their respective rights holders.
