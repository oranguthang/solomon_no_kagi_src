# Toolchain contract

The preservation build and runtime evidence use the pinned inputs declared in
`config/toolchain.json`. A matching filename is not sufficient: every executable
is checked by size and SHA-256 before it can participate in the corresponding
workflow.

## Build tools

The repository bundles `ca65.exe` and `ld65.exe` from cc65 2.19, upstream
revision `0fca835` (official Snapshot Build 795). Their version output, sizes,
source revision, and executable hashes are fixed in the toolchain manifest.
`make verify-build-toolchain` checks the actual paths selected by `CA65` and
`LD65`; both assembler prerequisites use that check as an order-only gate so a
changed executable cannot silently rebuild the ROM.

The upstream source and bundled license are documented in `bin/README.md` and
`bin/cc65-LICENSE.txt`. The checked binaries are development tools and contain
no game data.

## Runtime tool

Runtime evidence uses the external `oranguthang/fceux_automation` checkout at
commit `ec507d86c57acd8979547bc35e9627fb199fac9a`. The expected Windows x64
executable is source-built from that commit and has SHA-256
`97aadff4970e98a413377810a296c045fab717661dd8270f84d58190f43a232e`.

`make verify-runtime-toolchain` checks the executable selected by `FCEUX`, then
checks the HEAD of its source checkout. `make trace-runtime` depends on this
gate. A different emulator build is intentionally rejected even if it accepts
the same Lua API, because it has not produced the reviewed traces.

## Private reference input

The ignored USA ROM is identified by size 65,552 and SHA-256
`3d9f3bee199a3fbc04bab38e1d9d5cdeae1c6691dcca463a13c25e42f77bb03d`.
`make verify-private-input` checks the file selected by `REFERENCE_ROM` before
either verification or CHR extraction. `assets/manifest.json` independently
checks SHA-1, SHA-256, CRC32, container layout, and hashes of the significant
regions.

## Supported host

The release gate is supported on Windows x64 with Windows PowerShell 5.1,
Python 3.14.6, and GNU Make 4.4.1. The Python validation and build wrappers are
tracked source; the host versions document the environment in which the release
gate is accepted rather than claiming that other environments cannot work.

Run all three input checks directly with:

```text
make verify-toolchain
```
