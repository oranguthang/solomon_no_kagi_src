# Source Reconstruction 2.1 release candidate

Source Reconstruction 2.1 is the compatible follow-up to the published 2.0
tag. It does not redefine the USA/European preservation profiles, their ROM
identities, runtime modes, authoring schemas, or fixed-layout capacity rules.
Those contracts remain anchored by `source-reconstruction-2.0`; the 2.1
manifest hashes every inherited section and rejects silent baseline drift.

## Accepted delta

The accepted compatible delta adds audible and channel-selectable Sound
Studio playback, more faithful native level previews, decoded procedural bonus
rooms, and a consolidated semantic assembly layout. Repository preparation adds
responsibility-owned Make fragments, categorized command help, a ROM-less
scaffold gate, mirrored tool/test responsibility packages behind
`scripts/run.py`, and a self-contained release manifest whose claims resolve
only to project-owned evidence. A separate workstation smoke now drives Save,
Build, Preview
or Play, and dirty-close behavior through all four public studios for both
accepted profiles.

The reader-facing documentation was reviewed as one corpus. Short routine notes
are consolidated into subsystem and lifecycle guides, the index follows reader
tasks, and `config/reconstruction/documentation_corpus.json` records every
document, retained filename family, consolidation, and size exception. The sole
label rename registry now lives with reconstruction configuration at
`config/reconstruction/label_renames.json`.

The full substantive commit interval starts immediately after the annotated 2.0
tag at `a95261592ce579195613099b1e6dd57c49812171` and currently ends at
`893dc5dc0ae3e6aa17328b35193031a01c5beaad`. The 30 commits in that interval
cover every source, tooling, evidence, and documentation change accepted for the
candidate. Later commits may change only the release manifest and this boundary
document unless the terminal commit and count are advanced again.

The compatible manifest is self-describing even though its preservation facts
remain inherited. It repeats the effective profile inventory, direct runtime
matrix, toolchain reference, artifact identities, and licensing declarations
from the immutable 2.0 manifest. Every requirement uses structured
`targets`, `files`, `scenarios`, and `artifacts` evidence; the minor aggregate
is satisfied by the complete compatible-minor gate.

Important authoring and evidence outputs are now atomically published through
a shared same-directory temporary writer. The same policy covers runtime Lua
results, and `make lint` prevents a new Python tool from bypassing the writer.

Public text is also checked as a repository boundary. `make
validate-public-text` scans tracked text and candidate-reachable commit metadata,
paths, and historical public-text blobs so removed drafts cannot silently leave
non-English material in the release history.

## Repository layout

Python tools and tests now occupy mirrored `authoring`, `build`, `runtime`, and
`validation` packages. Public Make targets dispatch them through the stable
`scripts/run.py` entry point, and `make lint` rejects new uncategorized Python
tools. Historical 1.0 and 2.0 tagged trees remain immutable; the current
project-owned manifest snapshots use neutral release-line metadata and resolve
former script paths through an explicit compatibility map.

Configuration follows the same ownership model: authoring, debugger,
reconstruction, and validation manifests live in named subdirectories, while
shared revision, toolchain, and release contracts stay at `config/` root.
`make lint` rejects a new uncategorized JSON file. The published 2.0 tag and
its recorded tagged manifest remain immutable; current validators compare its
project-owned fields through the same compatibility map used for moved tools.

## Gates

Use the fast contract audit while developing:

```console
make source-2-minor-audit
```

The complete compatible-minor gate first executes the accepted 2.0 regression
gate, including the transitive Source 1.0 checks, and only then validates the
2.1 delta. It also runs `make lint` as a real public command inside a disposable
tracked-only clone, proving that the documented interface does not depend on
untracked local files or mutate a clean checkout. Before that command smoke,
the gate also exercises the editor workstation actions for USA and Europe:

```console
make source-2-minor-check
```

The editor interaction check is also available directly as
`make editor-ui-smoke-profiles`; select one revision with
`make editor-ui-smoke-profile PROFILE=usa|europe`.

`source-2-minor-pre-tag-check` validates the clean `tag-ready` candidate;
`source-2-minor-tag-check` is reserved for its future annotated published tag.
The Japanese profile, systematic relocation, expanded ROMs, and sibling
engines remain outside this compatible release.
