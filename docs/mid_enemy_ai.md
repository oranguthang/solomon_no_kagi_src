# Mid-table enemy AI families

`src/game/mid_enemy_ai.asm` owns CPU `$A68C-$A997`. It reconstructs four
unique targets used by the 28-word enemy AI handler table while keeping enemy
names neutral until type-to-creature identities are verified in play.

Each family begins with `LoadEnemyActionSelector`, which divides object action
byte 3 by four, followed by `JumpWithParams` and an inline little-endian action
table. The source expresses all four tables as `.addr`; bytes that looked like
overlapping instructions in the preservation listing are therefore recognized
as dispatcher data.

The `$10-$13` family has two actions. One resets phase and action state after a
threshold; the other allocates a free linked enemy slot and stores its index in
AI byte 6. The `$6C-$6F` family has seven action entries. Three paths use
different proximity thresholds before scheduling thread `$31`, while the
shared overlap helper compares Dana and enemy X coordinates over a ten-pixel
window.

The `$54-$5B` pair of dispatch entries share one seven-action table. Its main
update probes motion thresholds and the forward RoomMap cell, changes facing,
and can reserve two free enemy slots. Allocation is transactional: if the
second slot is unavailable, the first temporary record is disabled again.

The `$08-$0B` family handles fairy collection and a two-axis correction step.
Collection increments `FairiesCollected`, queues the normal item presentation,
and on every tenth fairy takes the extra-life presentation path. Its motion
routine uses four small signed-adjustment/limit tables at `$A988-$A997` to
update object Y and X motion while retaining a direction value in AI byte 6.

Several action targets beyond this range remain raw addresses because their
implementations still live in preservation source. The module nevertheless
assembles to exactly 780 bytes, and `make verify-prg` proves it is identical to
the original PRG image.
