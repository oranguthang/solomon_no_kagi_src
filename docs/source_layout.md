the command decoder, both direct-PPU layers, and their small fixed templates.

The two packed title streams own `$CD5F-$CEF0`; the 34-byte demo duration and
input tables immediately follow at `$CEF1-$CF34`.
The 58 four-byte logical RoomMap tile patterns own `$D000-$D0E7`.
`src/preservation/prg.asm` owns the unresolved ranges
between and after those modules. `src/graphics/chr.asm` includes the ignored CHR payload created by
`make split`; no CHR bytes are kept in Git.

This unusual naming is documented in `config/linker/cnrom.cfg`. Renaming a
segment is possible, but gives no semantic benefit until the PRG and CHR data
are divided into stable modules.

Every source split must remain address-ordered and pass `make verify` after
each boundary is introduced. `config/reconstruction.json` records accepted
module ranges and non-regression thresholds; `make reconstruction-audit`
checks those declarations against the linker map and label file. Tables that
cross a round-number address should not be split merely to create visually
neat files.
